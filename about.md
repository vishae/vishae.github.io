This is a blog about me and my interests. I'm the co-host of the [Trigger Point Podcast](https://triggerpointfm.wordpress.com) (we talk about 📺, 📚 and 🎥), writer of [Let It Flow](https://vtm.sleepyowl.ink), a cat’s human, and collector of hobbies.  

I'm a fan of tech stuff 💻, listener of audiobooks 🎧, reader of ebooks 📚 and binger of Netflix 📺.  

In case that's not enough, let me expound on that with the following:  

**Podcasts 🎙️:** ATP (I used to listen to more, but I've pretty much stopped commuting so I've lost my podcast listening time)  
**Watching 📺:** K-Drama (mainly romance, fantasy, sometimes action), C-Drama (mainly wuxia, transmigration, or reincarnation stories, _sometimes_ xianxia)
**Reading 📚:** Can be found on [LibaryThing](https://www.librarything.com/profile/vishae)  
**Games 🎲:** Tabletop RPG (Pathfinder, Starforged), and Love & Deepspace  
**Others:** 🖋️ Sailor Pro Gear, 📓 BuJo, ✍️ Nanowrimo, Traveler's Notebook
